# CHANGELOG

## 2.x.x

Shorthand methods `tai.unixToAtomic` and `tai.atomicToUnix` have been removed; it's now required to explicitly choose either `tai.oneToMany` or `tai.oneToOne` when performing conversions.

All methods no longer either accept or return fractional input. Inputs must be integer numbers of milliseconds or an exception will be thrown. Return values will be integer milliseconds, with fractional results having been rounded down (towards negative infinity).

New methods `tai.oneToMany.unixToAtomicPicos` and `tai.oneToOne.unixToAtomicPicos` have been introduced. These return BigInt TAI picosecond counts which are always precise.

Internal logic for conversions prior to 1972 (variable-length Unix seconds) has been fine-tuned.

Support for Node.js 10 is dropped.

## 1.x.x

Initial release.
