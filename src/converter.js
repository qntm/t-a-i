// The way to think about this is a 2D graph with TAI on the X axis, UTC on the Y, and a collection
// of numbered *segments*. Each segment starts at a well defined position in both TAI and UTC and
// proceeds diagonally up and to the right, expressing *one* relationship between the two.
// Typically each new segment is either (1) the previous segment translated up or down a little or
// (2) a discrete change in direction/slope of the previous segment with no discontinuity.
// A segment becomes invalid once we reach the TAI start point of the next (numerical) segment. So,
// every TAI time (vertical line) intersects exactly one segment, and maps to exactly 1 UTC time,
// unless it precedes the beginning of TAI.
// A UTC time (horizontal line) can intersect 0, 1, 2 or theoretically many more segments, and hence
// map to multiple TAI times. We can return an array of these, or just the result from the latest
// segment (according to its numbering).
